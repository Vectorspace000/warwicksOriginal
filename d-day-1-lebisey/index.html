                                Early in the morning of&nbsp;D-Day+1 morning the
                                Battalion was called into action to clear the
                                remaining suburbs of Benouville before attacking
                                south, capturing Lebisey Wood and the
                                accompanying village which sat on a hill
                                overlooking the&nbsp;city of Caen. The start
                                line for the main&nbsp;attack on Lebisey
                                &nbsp;(a stream just to the south of
                                Benouville)&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;in enemy hands
                                and so the plan called &nbsp;for the Battalion
                                to clear the remaining enemy presence in the
                                area around Benouville before launching the
                                attack proper. This was to be with A, B and C
                                company, D company was still entrenched to the
                                north-east at Pegasus Bridge. The Battalions S
                                (Support) company, made up of 6 pounder anti
                                tank guns and&nbsp;3 inch mortars was held at
                                the already occupied town of Bieville, north on
                                the main road from Lebisey.&nbsp;This
                                was&nbsp;due to&nbsp;the poor, marshy terrain on
                                the slopes leading to Lebisey which the
                                carriers, fully loaded, would not have been able
                                to traverse.<br />

                                It is worth noting that on D-Day itself,
                                elements of the&nbsp;2nd Battalion, Kings
                                Shropshire Light Infantry (KSLI), supported by
                                a&nbsp;squadron&nbsp;of Sherman tanks from the
                                Staffordshire Yeomanry, were&nbsp;able to push
                                into Lebisey in the late evening&nbsp;against
                                strong enemy&nbsp;resistance. Despite this
                                success, the KSLI and tanks&nbsp;were ordered to
                                withdraw from the area as there was a concern
                                that a strong enemy counter attack could push
                                them from their&nbsp;positions. This proved to
                                be a valid concern, as elements of the 125th
                                Panzer Grenadier Regiment and 22nd Panzer
                                Regiment, part of the 21st Panzer
                                Division,&nbsp;moved in overnight and fortified
                                their positions that the Warwicks were fated to
                                attack the next day. This unit, recreated after

                                  which had been dug in overnight to make them
                                  cornerstones of the Lebisey defences which, if
                                  necessary, could be moved for
                                  counterattacks.&nbsp;</span

                                In addition to the defences prepared in and
                                around the wood, the enemy had also constructed
                                a large anti tank ditch on the approach slope to
                                Lebisey which seriously hindered the
                                Staffordshire Yeomanry during its&nbsp;advance
                                with the KSLI. This is noted on the map above

                              On June 7th, the Warwicks initial plan of clearing
                              the suburbs of Benouville were carried out swiftly
                              without serious resistance. The next stage called
                              for the Warwicks three&nbsp;available infantry
                              companies to advance from the river to the wood in
                              an arrow formation, following a&nbsp;barrage from
                              a Royal Navy cruiser&nbsp;and artillery support
                              from 7th Field Field Battery. The option of tank
                              support from the Staffordshire Yeomanry&nbsp;had
                              been ruled out due to the aforementioned anti tank
                              ditch.&nbsp;When the Infantry attacked, they would
                              do so without armour.

                                  change from the offset. The commander of A
                                  company (Capt Illing), whilst conducting some
                                  reconnaissance of the immediate area mounted
                                  in a Bren Carrier,&nbsp;came under sustained
                                  small arms fire. Thankfully no one was injured
                                  but this, along with other, similar incidents,
                                  showed that the 'start line' for the attack
                                  (the area around the stream) was not secure,
                                  making a concerted attack very
                                  difficult.&nbsp;

                                With this in mind, Captain Illing communicated
                                the situation to Lieutenant- Colonel Herdon
                                who&nbsp;took the decision to delay the main
                                attack on Lebisey by an hour to allow the start
                                line to be secured prior to the advance, with
                                the aim of rescheduling the artillery and naval
                                support to match the attack.&nbsp;Whilst this
                                was able to be&nbsp;communicated&nbsp;across A
                                company, the other commanders and section
                                leaders of B &amp; C companies were not able to
                                be reached on Battalion radios, meaning the
                                delay order was never received.&nbsp;This may
                                well have been due to the nature of the radios
                                in use at the time&nbsp;which&nbsp;could only
                                either send or receive on certain settings, but
                                could not do both at the same time, let alone
                                try to cope any interference picked up from the
                                surrounding area.

                              almost all fire support. The only artillery
                              support available, according to some accounts, was
                              from 'two self&nbsp;propelled guns'. As to what
                              these vehicles were is still being researched, but
                              there are&nbsp;two most likely candidates. One is
                              two self propelled 'Priest' guns (105mm
                              Howitzers,&nbsp;mounted on Sherman tank chassis)
                              from 7th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery. The
                              other is two M-10 Wolverine tank hunters, as part
                              20th Anti-Tank, Royal Artillery. Whichever this
                              option is proved to be true, these guns were able
                              to provide the Warwicks with at least some fire
                              support,&nbsp;delivering High Explosive and smoke

                            grenadiers opened fire. Small arms, emplaced machine

                            deadly fire upon the Warwicks who went to ground and
                            returned fire where they could whilst still trying
                            to push forwards. One platoon of B company,&nbsp;led

                            During&nbsp;their&nbsp;approach to&nbsp;the woods
                            German mortar and small arms&nbsp;began to close in

                            the front carriers continued their advance as fast
                            as possible, coming straight into Lebisey wood and
                            town via&nbsp;the main road.&nbsp;Captain Bannerman

                            loose. The noise was fantastic, cracking and humming
                            past us. Luckily the banks were high and I suppose
                            we were too low for them. Somehow we weren't hit [in
                            his own carrier, though all the five following him
                            were knocked out] and we pressed on up the hill. We
                            couldn't turn round and anyhow I felt to stop was
                            fatal so we accelerated madly and fired our Bren and
                            our Stens at either side of the road as we passed.
                            Suddenly appeared a low bridge and a mass of rubble
                            and broken houses that was Lebisey. Worse still was
                            the sigh of scurrying Germans .. darting behind the
                            houses as we careered forlornly into the middle of
                            them... We passed a Mark 4 [panzer]
                            tank&nbsp;whose&nbsp;crew seemed almost as surprised
                            to see us as we were to&nbsp;see them...At last we
                            were out of the village and on a road between wide
                            wheat fields. It was the main road to Caen...So we
                            stopped and baled out in a wild frenzy and I gave
                            the order I had always felt certain of never giving:
                            'Action&nbsp;rear'. To fire backwards! Our gun drill
                            wasn't bad, though I think the language was far from
                            the drill book.The gun was soon firing, and joy, we
                            hit and holed the tank which had poked out from
                            behind a house... We got off about 8 rounds ...,
                            while a German machine gun sprayed the wheat around
                            us and ricocheted&nbsp;off the road. I remember the
                            loader... quite imperturbable- and another
                            Birmingham lad firing the gun with a gleaming smile
                            and a flood of obscenity. Suddenly an 88 [
                            German&nbsp;88mm anti-tank/ anti-air gun] got our
                            range and up went our carrier with all our
                            ammunition, knocking us all sideways...'

                            By 16:00 the 4 embattled companies of the Warwicks
                            were reported surrounded&nbsp;and, by 17:00, reports
                            came in stating that they were under increasingly
                            powerful attacks from German armour and that
                            ammunition supplies were dwindling. Although
                            surrounded may not have been correct, the urgency
                            and danger of the Battalion's plight was correct. To
                            try and address the situation, the 1st Battalion
                            Royal Norfolks were moved forwards in an attempt to
                            press the attack forward. They advanced, following
                            the eastern most route that the Warwicks D company
                            had followed to Lebisey, receiving small arms fire
                            as they did so. Just like the Warwicks before
                            them,&nbsp;the Norfolks&nbsp;was forced to move
                            forwards with no artillery support, however, at
                            least some elements of&nbsp;the King Shropshire
                            Light Infantry&nbsp;added their small arms&nbsp;fire
                            to support&nbsp;the&nbsp;attack and the Royal
                            Norfolks&nbsp;were able to bring up their S Company,
                            meaning that their 6 pounder anti tank
                            guns&nbsp;were finally able to bring some much
                            needed anti armour&nbsp;support to the embattled
                            infantry. At this point in the fighting the British
                            army had committed roughly&nbsp;2000 British
                            servicemen in one way or another to the attack on a
                            front less than a mile wide from east to west.

                              returned to the Battalion the roster of dead,
                              wounded and missing was tallied. The Battalion
                              lost 154 fighting men, officers and other ranks,
                              with the Norfolks adding a further 50 to
                              the&nbsp;'butcher's bill'. The irony here would be
                              to say that the casualty reports, although grim
                              reading, were not as bad as Brigade staff first
                              thought. However,&nbsp;to put it into context,
                              killed,&nbsp;wounded and captured, the British
                              army lost over a companys&nbsp;worth of infantry,
                              for no geographical advance.
                              Caen,&nbsp;Monty's&nbsp;D-Day objective, was
                              not&nbsp;to be liberated (and bodies of some
                              of&nbsp;the 2nd Battalion recovered),&nbsp;for
                              another month, on July 8th.</span

                              warfare, where artillery (and in this case

                              positions.&nbsp;This stalemate was to continue
                              until the 21st Panzer Division was&nbsp;relieved
                              by the 16 Luftwaffe Feld-Division (moved in from
                              Holland). The 2nd Battalion, after their action on
                              the 7th, would spend the next month re-building
                              and re-organising before being pushed onwards
                              towards Caen.</span
